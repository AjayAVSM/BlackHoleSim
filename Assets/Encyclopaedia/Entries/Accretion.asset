  title: Accretion
  description: Accretion is the process where matter falls onto a massive object
    due to gravity. Around black holes, this matter forms a swirling disk of gas
    and dust called an accretion disk. As the material spirals inward, it heats up
    and glows brightly, often outshining the entire galaxy around it. This process
    powers some of the brightest objects in the universe, known as quasars. Studying
    accretion helps us understand how black holes grow and how they affect their
    surroundings.
  tryItOutDescription: In the real photo of the young star "HL Tauri" you can see
    a massive collection of glowing gas and dust swirling around the gravitational
    source. In the simulation you can witness this phenomenon by increasing the Accretion
    Rate slider. Notice how the centre glows brighter than the outer edges.
