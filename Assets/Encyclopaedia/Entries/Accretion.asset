  title: Accretion
  description: "Accretion is the process where matter falls onto a massive object
    due to gravity. Around black holes, this matter forms a swirling disk of gas
    and dust called an accretion disk. \n\nAs the material spirals inward, it heats
    up and glows brightly, often outshining the entire galaxy around it. This process
    powers some of the brightest objects in the universe, known as quasars. Studying
    accretion helps us understand how black holes grow and how they affect their
    surroundings."
  tryItOutDescription: "In NASA\u2019s SVS renders of black holes, a bright disk
    of super-heated gas and dust forms around the central object as material falls
    inward under strong gravitational forces. Friction and compression cause the
    disk to heat up, making the inner regions much hotter and brighter than the outer
    areas.\n\nIn this simulation, increasing the Accretion Rate adds more material
    to the disk. As the disk becomes denser and hotter, the brightness near the center
    increases noticeably \u2014 similar to what is shown in NASA\u2019s visualizations."
