  title: Black Body Radiation
  description: 'Every hot object emits light, and its color depends on temperature.
    This is called blackbody radiation. Cooler matter glows red, while hotter matter
    shifts through white to blue.


    In an accretion disk, gas spirals toward
    the black hole and heats up due to friction and immense gravitational energy.
    Less intense black holes are cooler and reddish, but stronger black holes reach
    millions of degrees and emit bluish light.


    This color change is a visual
    clue to the energy of the disk and helps scientists estimate its temperature
    and luminosity.'

    star representing high-temperature radiation. [\xA9 S. Smith (Bondboy9756), CC
    BY-SA 4.0]. \n\nIn the simulation you can observe the same effect by increasing
    the temperature of the accretion disk"
