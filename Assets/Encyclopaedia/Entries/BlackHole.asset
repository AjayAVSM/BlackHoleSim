  title: Black Hole
  description: "A black hole forms when a massive star collapses under its own gravity,
    compressing all its mass into an incredibly tiny point called the singularity.
    The gravity becomes so strong that beyond a certain boundary, the \"event horizon\"
    escape becomes impossible. Not even light can get out. That\u2019s why black
    holes look \u201Cblack.\u201D Anything that crosses the event horizon is gone
    forever, doomed to spiral inward and stretch into atoms, however Black holes
    are not cosmic vacuum cleaners sucking everything in, you can safely orbit one
    from far enough away just like any massive object.\n\nBut black holes rarely
    sit quietly. Gas, dust, and sometimes unlucky stars swirl toward them at extreme
    speeds, forming a spinning accretion disk. The friction and collisions inside
    this disk heat it to unbelievable temperatures, making it glow bright enough
    to be seen across galaxies. The faster the gas orbits, the hotter and brighter
    it gets, especially near the center. That\u2019s why black holes are often surrounded
    by beautiful, deadly light."
  tryItOutDescription: "Light near a black hole doesn\u2019t travel in straight lines.
    Gravity warps spacetime, bending light into curves. This makes the flat accretion
    disk appear as a glowing halo above and below the black hole \u2014 a weird optical
    illusion caused by relativistic lensing. The inner disk is much brighter because
    orbits accelerate dramatically as material spirals inward, radiating more energy.\n\nThe
    simulation recreates these effects using ray-marching techniques to approximate
    how light bends around the black hole, along with simplified relativistic behavior
    for the spinning accretion disk."
