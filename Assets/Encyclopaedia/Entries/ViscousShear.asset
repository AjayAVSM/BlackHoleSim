  title: Viscous Shearing
  description: 'In an accretion disk, the material closer to the black hole orbits
    much faster than the material farther away. This difference in orbital speed
    creates viscous shearing, a friction-like effect that causes the gas to heat
    up as it rubs and interacts at different layers.


    The stronger the shear,
    the more energy is converted into heat. As a result, the inner regions of the
    disk become significantly hotter and brighter than the outskirts.'
  tryItOutDescription: "In the real image of HD 141569A, the inner part of the accretion
    disk appears noticeably brighter than the outer regions, because the gas closer
    to the star experiences stronger shearing and heats up more. \n\nIn the simulation,
    this same behaviour can be observed by adjusting the Shear Intensity slider.
    When the value is higher, the bright central zone spreads outward while the edges
    dim. When the value is reduced, the brightness drops off more sharply, creating
    a steeper gradient from the centre to the outer disk, closely matching what you
    see in the real observation."
