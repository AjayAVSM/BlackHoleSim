  title: Photon Ring
  description: "Near the event horizon, gravity becomes so extreme that light itself
    can be trapped in orbit around the black hole. This creates a razor-thin structure
    called the photon ring. It isn\u2019t part of the accretion disk \u2014 it\u2019s
    literally made of photons whipping around the black hole at nearly the speed
    of light. Because this region is where spacetime distortion is at its most chaotic,
    even tiny changes in angle send light spiraling inward or flinging outward into
    the universe.\n\nThe photon ring is incredibly bright and sharp compared to the
    rest of the disk. Most of the light we see doesn\u2019t even come from gas at
    that exact spot \u2014 it\u2019s light from the accretion disk behind the black
    hole, bent back toward us like a gravitational boomerang. You\u2019re basically
    staring at the universe being folded in on itself by gravity."
  tryItOutDescription: "Visually, the photon ring appears as a thin inner halo \u2014
    the closest \u201Cedge\u201D of the black hole that we can actually see. It outlines
    the pitch-black event horizon and creates the iconic glowing border that most
    people think of when they picture a black hole. \n\nThe simulation generates
    this effect using a strong gravitational lensing approximation near the center.
    As rays approach the black hole, the shader warps their paths to create a concentrated
    ring of brightness where light would realistically orbit before escaping, giving
    users a direct way to visualize the threshold between visible physics and the
    point of no return."
