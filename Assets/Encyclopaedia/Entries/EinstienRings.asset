  title: Einstein Ring
  description: 'An Einstein Ring is a special case of gravitational lensing, where
    the light from a distant galaxy or star is bent by the gravity of a massive object,
    like a black hole, lying directly between it and us. When the alignment is nearly
    perfect, the bent light forms a full circle around the massive object, which
    we see as a glowing ring.


    Einstein Rings are not just visually striking,
    they are powerful tools in astrophysics. By measuring the size of the ring, scientists
    can estimate the mass of the lensing object and the distances involved. This
    makes them important in studying dark matter, black holes, and even the large-scale
    structure of the universe.'
  tryItOutDescription: "The real image shows a Luminous Red Galaxy lensing the light
    of a more distant Blue Galaxy forming an Einstien Ring. Similarly in the Simulation
    the black hole lenses the light of a  star cluster in the background. \n\nYou
    can try out this phenomenon by setting accretion rate to 0 and aligning the camera
    with a bright object in the background."
