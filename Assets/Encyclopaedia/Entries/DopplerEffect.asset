  title: Doppler Effect
  description: The Doppler Effect is the change in the observed frequency of light
    caused by the motion of the source relative to the observer. In an accretion
    disk, material moving toward us appears brighter and shifted toward blue light,
    while material moving away appears dimmer and shifted toward red light. This
    effect helps astronomers measure the speed and behavior of matter around black
    holes and other cosmic objects.
  tryItOutDescription: The real image shows the black hole at the centre of the Messier
    87 galaxy more than 50 million light years away. You can notice how one side
    is much brighter than the other due to the relativistic doppler effect. You can
    try this out in the simulator by increasing the Orbital Velocity Slider, as the
    formula implies a propotional increase in the effect with increase in velocity.
